			<h1>Dennis Chen’s Website</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Dennis, and I’ll be studying computer science at CMU
starting Fall ’23 and anticipate to graduate in the spring of ’27.</p>
<p>People mostly know me for my work in math contests, particularly with
<a href="https://mathadvance.org">Math Advance</a>, which I am the
director of. Right now us prefrosh students are changing the direction
of Math Advance to focus less on contests and more on general outreach,
exposition, and teaching.</p>
<p>My interests change pretty frequently, but some things I like to do
as of now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Computers (Rust, Linux, LaTeX, some sysadmin stuff, HTML + CSS)</li>
<li>Writing</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did design work before. The first draft of the MAT logo was by
me. William changed it to a purple color scheme, which is currently on
the final logo. I also have amateurish book, handout, and CV designs,
the last two of which have been used semi-often by other people.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/sudoku-variants">Variant Sudoku</a> puzzles follow typical
sudoku rules, but typically with a twist. Sometimes you may have to
“color” cells that you know are the same but don’t know the value of
yet, and sometimes you will even have to construct the regions of the
puzzle yourself. I have some <a href="puzz-rec">beginner
recommendations</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/hanabi">Hanabi</a> is a cooperative card game where you
see everyone’s cards except your own. You give clues (color, number) to
your teammates so they learn the identity of their cards, and they give
you clues so you learn your cards. The goal is to play stacks of cards
like in solitaire — the default is 5 stacks of 5 different colors, but
this can change.</li>
